              <p>I am Vegan, and I will remain so for the rest of my life. I haver tried watching some of the Vegan and PETA propaganda videos such as 
Earthlings and (God Forbid) Dominion. I know these things show the brutal truth about slaughter houses but I am just not able to 
tolerate watching so much cruelty to animals. I have watched many horror movies in my life but I have never seen anything as brutal
and cruel as the things shown in these films. Never in my life would I wish for anyone to watch Dominion and I would never ever let a 
child watch such terrible things. I can’t control the world and I can’t control other people but I know in my heart I cannot 
contribute to such horrifying treatment of animals. I know animals die, I know that we die. The problem I have with slaughter houses
is not that animals die in them but rather the excessive cruelty and pain and suffering these animnals undergo in the name of
industrial efficiency.</p>

              <p><strong>“We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate for having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein do we err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth.”</strong><br />
― Henry Beston, The Outermost House: A Year of Life on the Great Beach of Cape Cod</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>The great stoic Epictetus had a golden saying (that I got a tattoo of) “Bear and Forbear”. Meaning that we had to endure and had to have restraint and discipline in order to have the best life. 
The great stoic Marcus Aurelius said that we must accept that each day we will meet selfish, impertinent and greedy people. His point being that once we expect this and understand it those people and condition will be easier to bear. Today is really pushing me to that limit and I am forced to remind myself multiple times that I should have expected this and I must endure.</p>
