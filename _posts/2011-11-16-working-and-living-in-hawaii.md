Loving it out here in Hawai'i. I met my lab manager, his name is Justin, and so far he is a pretty cool guy, glad I will be working with him. All in all this was a great decision moving out here, plan to go snorkelling in some secret local lagoons that have been recommended to me, still so crazy learning how to drive and get around here, still looking for an apartment, looking for a car, but have a feeling that things are going to work out well.
