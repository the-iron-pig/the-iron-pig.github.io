Ever since I came here to Hawaii, and saw how poorly the highways are designed, how jammed the traffic gets, and how reckless some of the developments are I have started to feel like I can sympathize with some of the native people s notions of "just say no" to further development of Oahu. They have been the victims of poor public planning, Urban sprawl, and political crookery for far too long. 
Hawaii is a world-class destination, and Honolulu a world-class city, that is forced to get by on 1950's planning and design. We are very close to the choke point where business and tourism will be at capacity, and I shudder to think of the chaos we are heading towards if sprawl is  to continue the way it has been .
The only way out of this mess is to say no to the past, and say yes to an intelligent, cost efficient system, that is actually planned right. Like the Rail. After having been burned so many times in the past many here do not want to risk more on a new project, but the problem is not just one of risk, it is a matter of the future, and setting a precedent.
It is a travesty that during rush hour gridlock, thousands of vehicles for miles stop being vehicles (since they aren't moving) and become pollution machines, whose only function is to convert gasoline into smog. Many on the island aren't concerned about smog, since we are an island, but globally this is a disaster. 
I know Rail is expensive! But doing the right thing the right way always is! It will connect Kapolei with the AlaMoana Center Via the Aloha stadium and the airport, this will take thousands of cars off the road, help tourists going from Airport to Town or Kapolei, and allow some commuters from Kapolei to live without a car.
One of the best payoffs a City can have is investing in infrastructure that is actually worth it! It saves the City and citizens money in the long run, and it's a step in the right direction for the future of Hawaii, towards an efficient, smart, and cleaner future.
