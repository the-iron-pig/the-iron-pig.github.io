Packing, Lifting, Carrying. is there anything quite so fun as moving? So far the bright spot in my week is that I have setup an artificial intelligence program that plays the game of go on the KGS go server. His name is BAMFBOT. I will have to do a lot of tweaking, maybe I can even change his playing algorythm altogether. But who knows, right now I just get to move boxes. Talk to you all soon.
