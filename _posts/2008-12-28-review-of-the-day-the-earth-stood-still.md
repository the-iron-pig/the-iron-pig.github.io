Ok, a lot of critics have been bashing this movie, mostly because faulty memory has caused them to remember the original being far greater than it was, I too loved the original, and found it very appealing, especially GORT, and yes, I said the phrase "Klattu Barrada Nikto" more than once. Despite all the critical nay-saying I really liked this movie, it was very faithful in feeling to the sentiment of the original, with very appropriate modifications for modern times. The new GORT is just AWESOME, special effects were excellent, Surfer Keanu did justice to the role of Klattu. In the original film Klattu came to Earth basically tro give a warning, shape up to the standards of the galatic UN, or you will be annihilated. In the modern version, Klattu is from the galactic EPA, and he's just here to annihilate us, we already had our warnings. I really enjoyed this movie and find it to be a worthy homage to the original.
