Lately I have been working on the Kawailoa wind Farm Project. Seeing the progress of the project makes me proud to be a part of it. The smartest societies have found ways to make wise use of their blessings, and the Trade Winds have blessed Hawai'i for centuries. Here is a view from one of the Wind Farm Hills, near Haleiwa.

This project is going to be very good for Hawai'i. For me, at least, this points the way to the future, smarter and better energy, and it makes me proud that it is Hawai'i that is doing it, this coupled with the Monorail will show the way that not only be the future for Hawai'i, but for the rest of the World.
Here are some of the Wind Turbine Generator in various stages of construction...

In the last pic you can see some fully constructed, although not yet functional Wind turbines, I find this beautiful, clean energy, from the tradewinds, in pristine nature. Somehow it seems to me to be the way of building everything better in the world, instead of tearing town forests and displacing wildlife, integrate them.
