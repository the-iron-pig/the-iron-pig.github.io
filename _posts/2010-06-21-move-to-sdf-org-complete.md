Well, Here I am. It seems there was a little slicing and dicing involved, lost a few posts and a few pictures, but all that will be fixed gradually. To prove that this is now my current and legit blog I will post my graduation photo:

I am currently listening to "The Fall and Rise of China" and audio-book lecture series from the Teaching Company, it's an incredibly fascinating course on the history of China, from before the Boxer Rebellion to Current Events, I had no idea China had been through so much, if you have ever had the slightest inclination to learn about China's history I <strong><em>HIGHLY</em></strong> recommend it, the professor who teaches it is immensely entertaining, having been through a few international spy like adventures of his own when he was in China, and he goes into detail about those exploits as well. Just Fascinating!
