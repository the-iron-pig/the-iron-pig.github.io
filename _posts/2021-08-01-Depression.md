My depression has come back, not really sure why. I think I am experiencing work burnout. Having panic attacks,
trouble sleeping, and little interest in hobbies. I am on a new medication, but it is taking its time in 
re-balancing. I hope it adjusts soon, I am getting overly sensitive about work. Why post something so personal
on the internet you might ask? Because I am tired of stigma around mental health. One of my worst contributing
factors to depression is denial. Tired of pretending, and tired of being tired.
