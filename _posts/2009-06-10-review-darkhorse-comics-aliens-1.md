Ok, I am minorly pissed off about this, first off, <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/">Dark Horse </a>announced this title almost two months ago, and then delayed it by a month, and then delayed it AGAIN. I am a major Aliens fan, I have seen all the movies, read every one of the novels, collected the memorabilia etc. I found issue number one disappointing, probably the single most irritating thing about this issue is that it is 36 pages, <strong>14 of which are ADS and editorials</strong>, (not counting the Covers) giving it an advertisement ratio of 39%. The art is beautiful, the pages are excellently inked and glossy, the aliens are slightly funky looking and not true the vision of H.R. Gieger, but all that aside the story content was just too brief and weak, it's like<a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/"> Dark Horse</a> <em>wants </em>their new series to fail, if I ran a comic business issue one would have extra pages, extra story, giving me the best chance to hook new readers, and sadly Dark Horse did the opposite. The story so far is a weak re-visiting of the second movie, and it parrots the look and feel of that movie as well, which in this case turns out to <strong>not</strong> be a good thing.  They seem to have pulled the most overdone gag in this series, killing a main character, only to have him come back from the dead as you realize he was the Android member of the crew, all in issue #1. I am going to give this series one more chance and buy issue number 2 when it comes out July 22 (??????) if it doesn't shape up by then I'm going to bag the whole series and just wait for the omnibus.
