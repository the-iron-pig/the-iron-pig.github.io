I was laid off today, that was pretty hard for me, but I actually suspect it may have been a little harder for my boss, which was why I felt it was best to exit the situation with grace. In all honesty, it couldn't have come at a better time, it's time for changes, and now the fire under my ass has been lit. I hope to be able to post here soon about new successes in writing and programming and personal growth. Let's see what happens...
