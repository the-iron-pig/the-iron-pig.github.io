I need a vacation so badly, but have decided that this weekend would be better spent just resting and doing homework. So I am going to order in Thai food, and buckle down for 10 hours of homework. I have been journaling recently, on advice from a book on writing, and it seems to be having some effect, hopefully soon I will be able to actually get some stories out of my mind and down on paper. <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware 13.0</a> is awesome, but I can't use it this semester for school, so am currently running 32-bit <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">ubuntu linux</a> on a 64-bit system in the interest of being able to run the database software I need for classes. As soon as the semester is over I'm wiping and putting on 64-bit Slackware. As promised, here is a cool bug image...
