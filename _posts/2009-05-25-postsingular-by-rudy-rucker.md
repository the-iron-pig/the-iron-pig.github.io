I read his "Wares" series before and loved it, and always hoped he would continue that series, well this is even better, its a new take on the same ideas. This is a great novel, exciting, inciteful, entertaining as hell, and it really makes you think. Nobody makes spacial topology as interesting a plot point like Rucker can. The new book in the series comes out tomorrow, calledÂ  HYLOZOIC

If you like SciFi and whacky fun stuff that is so original you don't even know what to think, then do yourself a favor and pick up this book, you won't be disappointed.
