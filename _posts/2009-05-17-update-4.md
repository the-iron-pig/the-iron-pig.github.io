Well, I've had a good, but busy, weekend. Saturday morning I got up early to go do the ACI proctoring, then had to go to work to pick up my friend JK to go to sushi. We got stuck in traffic, but made it. The sushi was my idea, I wanted to take my friend and co-worker out to try it for his very first time, so yes, I popped his sushi-cherry. He loved it, he was so full when he left he looked like he was about to give birth. Then I went to Corporate Challenge chess, where my team, known as "The TEAM" have had a winning streak for the last three years running, and our streak finally broke, we fought well and hard, but in the end, the last minute changes to our line-up killed us, and we lost the gold by 1/2 point. We took silver, which secretly irked everyone on my team, and as we were getting our medals our team captain spontaneously swore a vendetta against the winners, that we would destroy them next year. I don't know how wise that was, but we'll see.Â  It was such a close defeat that everyone blamed themselves, and as I was walking down the street to my car, the captain of the winning team drove by with his head out the window squelching mocking laughter, for some people chess is a blood sport, and seeing his pompous ass gloating, I swore we WOULD defeat them next year.

So far the dreaded layoffs haven't happened at work yet, I guess we will find out soon, but the tension is killing everyone and destroying moral. I hope we can work something out soon. Here is a pic of my friend JK being a moron at the Sushi Bar:

Do not be alarmed by the new crazy cartoon face icons that appear in your comments, it is a program I started running, it auto assigns a crazy monster face to everyone, even moi, and I can't even change them, they are meant to be funny, and I think the kind of are, so no worries. I am not making fun of you, to your faces anyways.
