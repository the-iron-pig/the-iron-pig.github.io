I just finished some scripts to improve functionality of my homepage at <a href="http://woh3.sdf.org">woh3.sdf.org</a> particularly the "My Go Games" section, none of that is hard-coded, but are rather scripts in php that update page data by themselves whenever I upload a new game file, my favorite thing is the game data box which parses the game files for certain information about the game, it was pretty darn cool and took me a lot of effort, so you should check it out. So There.
