Well, in previous post I mentioned an Evil Dead TV series, it seems this is a semi-hoax, or at least Bruce Campbell is denying any knowledge of it. As exciting as this seems, I would hope much more for a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasm_(film)">Phantasm</a>" tv-series, Evil 
Dead has pretty much played itself out in terms of plot, and would just wind up being a clone of "Supernatural", but I think a Phantasm franchise could be a new kind of horror/scifi serial, especially if they keep "The Silver Ball".
