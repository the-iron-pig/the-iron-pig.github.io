<p>A few days ago one of my co-workers was in the office saying some really anti-gay comments, along the lines of how he thought it was appropriate to use baseball bats on gay teenagers. it pissed me off, I complained, talked with people, and blogged about it on facebook. Mostly because I honestly didn't think i had a recourse at work, my workplace isn't exactly &quot;PC&quot;. So it was actually a huge surprise to me when one of the owners came to me and said that he would make it right. I have no idea what the results will be, I have a nagging feeling that I've probably numbered my days with the company now. Who knows, not even sure I care anymore. All I know for sure is that I'm tired of putting up with that kind of thing. We'll see what happens.</p>
