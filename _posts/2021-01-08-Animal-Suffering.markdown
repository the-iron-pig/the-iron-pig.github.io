I am Vegan, and I will remain so for the rest of my life. I haver tried watching some of the Vegan and PETA propaganda videos such as 
Earthlings and (God Forbid) Dominion. I know these things show the brutal truth about slaughter houses but I am just not able to 
tolerate watching so much cruelty to animals. I have watched many horror movies in my life but I have never seen anything as brutal
and cruel as the things shown in these films. Never in my life would I wish for anyone to watch Dominion and I would never ever let a 
child watch such terrible things. I can't control the world and I can't control other people but I know in my heart I cannot 
contribute to such horrifying treatment of animals. I know animals die, I know that we die. The problem I have with slaughter houses
is not that animals die in them but rather the excessive cruelty and pain and suffering these animnals undergo in the name of
industrial efficiency.
