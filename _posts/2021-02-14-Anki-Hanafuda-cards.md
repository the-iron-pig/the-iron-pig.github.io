Anki is a wonderful program for making your own flashcards on the computer and quizzing yourself.
I have made a set of all the <a href="/Hanafuda-2021-02-14@12-53-54.colpkg">Hanfuda cards</a> to memorize the card flower and months as well as a basic set
for memorizing the <a href="/Yakus-2021-02-14@12-54-34.colpkg">Yakus</a>.
