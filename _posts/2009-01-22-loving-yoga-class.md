I decided that I needed to get back into shape, but didn't want to do a cold start lifting weights program, so I decided to ease back into it by starting yoga first. I think it was a lucky break that I chose that because Yoga is an excellent workout, I feel I benefit more physically from it then just thrashing on my muscles and It makes me feel better and more balanced. I've already started paying more attention to my body, my posture is better, and I'm calmer. Usually red lights piss me off, but lately, if I hit a red light, I'm like "cool, another chance to practice breathe of fire", and it's made a lot of other little differences too, like when I'm at the grocery store, long lines and slow cashiers used to piss me off, now I just get another chance to meditate or focus on my breathing. I'm really enjoying the changes it's making in my life. Think I might be hooked.
