I just had a pharmacist use a special drug discount card for people who don't have insurance for my partners heart medication and it saved us 50% on a 3 month supply, he said the card can be used by anyone (don't know if it only works at target or not) here is the info:
UNIVERSAL Rx CARD
<code>
BIN: 600428         Group ID: 05361001
PCN: 05080000    Member ID: 05361002
</code>
it says on the card "Discounts average 28%", "Any drug" and at the bottom left it says "FOR PHARMACY TECHS", "APPLY DISCOUNT FOR CASH PAYERS", then finally "UNLIMITED CARDHOLDERS &amp; USES"
