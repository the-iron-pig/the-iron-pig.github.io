So I got up early this morning, went to the <a href="http://www.concrete.org/general/home.asp">ACI</a> to make a quick c-note, then went to <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/">Barnes &amp; Nobles</a>, which is always a mistake when I have money in my pocket, but I resisted, and only bought a yoga mat. Then I met Nate, Kade and Sean to pig out on sushi at <a href="http://www.usmenuguide.com/yamasushi.html">YAMA</a>, it was funny to see Seans little belly stick out after he ate so much. I went to take care of the dogs, came home and read the last of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593079265">Aliens Omnibus</a>, and now going to get some much needed rest. I'm not even going to leave the house tomorrow except to go take care of the dogs for an hour or so, maybe do some yoga stretches, other than that, I'm in bed in my PJ's allday.
