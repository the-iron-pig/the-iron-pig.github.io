This was a surprisingly good movie, it is billed as "the Nerdiest Zombie Movie Ever", and I think they might be right. It takes place at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, and it seems the culprit that produces the zombies is "Higgs Boson Bio-Entanglement" it is free, and worth a watch, although you can probably skip the first fifteen minutes since it is mostly fluff about characters that are going to be toast anyways. Enjoy!!
