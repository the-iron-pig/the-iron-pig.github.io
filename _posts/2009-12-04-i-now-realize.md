I now realize that I have fallen into the bad habit of writing short, meaningless little posts and 'updates' that are only marginally better than twitters, and I will correct this soon. I have quit smoking, technically I think this is day 24, but the urge is pretty much gone now. I think I want to go back to Quaker worship meeting, maybe this weekend. Semester is drawing to a close, and finals are coming soon, once all that's done maybe I can marshal together enough will and write a few interesting things. My health is getting better, gained some weight from quitting smoking, but will take that off soon. I'm 38, and a lot of little things about my body seem to have changed, can't quite describe it, but I don't think it's bad. In fact probably the opposite, the only weird thing is I seem to have some strange impulse towards vegetarianism. I've had on and off flings with vegetarianism before, it never really lasted, but like I said, my body is changing, and responds pretty badly towards meat, in one way or another I usually wind up paying for each time I eat it. Maybe I'm just getting older, maybe I've just finally started listening to my body, but veggy diet seems to be the only things my body doesn't kick my ass for.
