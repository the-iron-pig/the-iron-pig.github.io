For once in a time that is longer than I can remember, I finally had a good relaxing weekend. I went to Friday night Go Club, of which I am president, and run the website at <a href="http://lvgoclub.org">LVGOCLUB.ORG</a> and was worried, but it turned out to be a really nice time. I went home, got some good sleep, and then met several friends and co-workers for sushi. I saw some very good movies, one of which was an unusually insiteful film called "Hard Pill" which was very entertaining and made an interesting point. Also a nice little horror movie that is a gestalt of john carpenters "The Thing", several zombie movies and BioHazard, called "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1031280/">Splinter</a>" which I thought was very good. I also saw a good sci-fi movie called "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462465/">Outlander</a>" which is billed as Predator Versus Beowulf, and it really delivered on that promise, it was well worth watching. I am currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swarm-Novel-Frank-Schatzing/dp/0060813261">The Swarm</a> <span>by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Frank%20Schatzing">Frank Schatzing</a></span>

<span><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-271" title="the-swarm" src="http://www.woh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/the-swarm.jpg" alt="the-swarm" width="315" height="470" />and it is very entertaining.</span>

<span>I also read an excellent book by the famous stoic philosopher named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus">Epictetus</a> called "The Art of Living" which was pretty deep and I'm still thinking about a lot the things it said, but sounds like good sound advice, and I plan to implement the ideas into my life.  On my ipod this week I am listening to the extremely entertaining "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-War-Z-History-Zombie/dp/0307346617/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246245210&amp;sr=1-1">World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War</a>" by Max Brooks, I highly recommend you pick it up.</span>

<span>I also found a very interesting singles site for geeks, called geek2geek, and I signed up. So far they don't seem fantastic, like they are just getting up and running, but still there are some interesting services and relationship possibilities on there. I'm curious to see what will come out of it.  So all in all, a very good weekend.</span>

<span>Also I am back to Ubuntu Linux, I usually prefer to stick with the less user friendly linuxes like slackware, but after a while I get tired of developing software and just want to use it for entertainment, and as you all know, Ubuntu has the market cornered right now, the only thing I don't like about Ubuntu is it's name, they should call it "really awesome" linux, or "just works great" linux. If you haven't swtiched to Linux yet, you need to do yourself a favor and download an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">iso here</a>.
