Well, about three nights ago, I woke up at 1:00 am with a toothache, I tried to fight it off, used aspirin, but lost in the end. I went to the dentist and he said root-canal. It went very well however, and was painless. Except afterwards, so I've been sitting at home, on painkillers, not allowed to drive. I worked on configuring my computer, updating my webpage at <a href="http://woh3.freeshell.org">http://woh3.freeshell.org</a> and other mindless tasks to fill my day. I did watch a couple of movies, <a title="Night of the Living Dead 1990" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100258/">Night of the Living Dead (1990)</a> is still a pretty good movie, and I realized just how much of it was packed into the other Romero remakes. I recompiled amarok to use mysql database, which I am proud of. I have been studying how to integrate PHP and MySQL to make interactive websites. Soon as I recover from all my bills I plan to get a DBA account with my freeshell and turn my entire site into a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) with CSS. Hopefully I can go back to work tomorrow, sitting at home on painkillers is not as fun as it might sound.
