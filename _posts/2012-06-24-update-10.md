Well, things look like they might be getting better here on Oahu. Only time will tell. Still reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/1Q84-Haruki-Murakami/dp/145583050X" target="_blank">Haruki Murakami's 1Q84</a> on my kindle, which is an excellent, but large book. Studying for my NICET Level II exam coming up in July. 
Trying to reach a happier mental place, I make pretty decent money, but Hawai'i is expensive, and I am tending to spend a lot more time than is healthy worrying about money. My job has been sending me to the Kawailoa Wind Farm a lot recently, which is on the beautiful North Shore. 
I will finally be receiving my <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> next Wednesday, if my tracking number information is correct, and I will be fooling around with it and installing <a href="http://www.armedslack.org/" target="_blank">ARMedSlack</a> on it, hopefully they finally will have a supported kernel for the Pi once it finally gets here. I will blog about it and review it.
I have had to miss the last two weeks of Mr. Pong's Tai-Chi class in Millilani Mauka, but got to go yesterday, and really enjoyed it. Next week our group of beginners will be joining the main class. 
The Homeowners Association sent a Gardener to kill one of the trees in our Lanai, this was upsetting since I thought it was illegal to kill trees here in Hawai'i, but it turns out it was an African Tulip, which is an aggressive and invasive species here on the island, it started flowering about a month ago, which is what gave its species identity away and got it targeted.
