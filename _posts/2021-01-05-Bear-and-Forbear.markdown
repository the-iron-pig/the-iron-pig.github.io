The great stoic Epictetus had a golden saying (that I got a tattoo of) "Bear and Forbear". Meaning that we had to endure and had to have restraint and discipline in order to have the best life. 
The great stoic Marcus Aurelius said that we must accept that each day we will meet selfish, impertinent and greedy people. His point being that once we expect this and understand it those people and condition will be easier to bear. Today is really pushing me to that limit and I am forced to remind myself multiple times that I should have expected this and I must endure.
