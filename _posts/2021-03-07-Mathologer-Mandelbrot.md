I love Mathologer's videos. He has done some really great ones,including a really good one on the factorization formula for cubic polynomials. This most recent one
about the Mandelbrot set is going to come in very handy in my exploration of the M-set. <br clear="all">

in general people use fractals as main examples of Chaos, so when trying to find structure in fractals it is tempting to just throw your hands up in the air and proclaim
"chaos", but that just isn't correct.
