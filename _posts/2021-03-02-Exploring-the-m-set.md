Lately I have been exploring the M-set in search of a configuration known as the 22-legged ant. No luck so far but I have found some interesting scenery.<br>
This one reminds me of Dragons:<br>

As you probably know fractals have infinite self-similar subsets, this one is nestled in the heart of a spiral arm:<br clear="all">

Initially this next one made me think I was getting closer to the configuration I was hunting for, but alas no, too many legs.<br clear="all">

I call this one the jellyfish:<br clear="all">

and I have labeled this one "The Cell"<br clear="all">
