Joe and I have moved into a new apartment which we are much happier with. We got a new car, which is actually my first time ever buying an actual "new car" which is very comfortable and we enjoy it. I find these simple changes are helping a lot with my stress levels and my average sleep score is going up. I am looking to the future now and thinking it may not be such a bad place.
