Well, it's Saturday, had to go into work today, which wasn't all that bad since I got to work with my good friend JK, who I haven't seen a lot of lately. We went to a nice Indian food restaurant I know of for lunch, trying to meet my science fiction writers group there, but I guess I had the date or times wrong. Now I am going to salvage the rest of my weekend, getting ready to watch the new episode of Stargate Universe, and then the new episode of Doctor Who, then will probably work on my website, trying to redo the whole thing in php, we'll see how it goes. I have decided that I am going to use the free linux video editing software to make several short documentaries about things that interest me, like I tentatively plan for my first episode to be an introduction to the BBC TV show Doctor Who, and why I think it is so great. The idea behind this is to get me producing content again which will ideally facilitate me getting back to writing. I have been kicking around an idea about a futuristic sci-fi story in which a Cyborg warrior is trapped in the mental manipulation programs of his exo-skeleton, which variously make him experience heaven and hell and the battle field, and he struggles to rediscover his humanity against that overpowering mindscape. I also would like to be able to get back to writing my novel "The Snakes of Terra", but have been too blocked. Perhaps I will dust it off for the upcoming national write your novel month. Time for Stargate...
