well, the job market is tough out there, and I passed all the tests to become a cab driver, so I'm working a couple of shifts a week for <a href="http://www.anlvcab.com/">ANLV cab</a>. I am still in a 30 day probationary period. I hope that business picks up like they say it will at and after new years, because I worked two twelve hour shifts and only made about $50 for that time. Despite the dismal earnings, I think I like it so far, but whether or not I'll be able to pay my rent with it remains to be seen.
