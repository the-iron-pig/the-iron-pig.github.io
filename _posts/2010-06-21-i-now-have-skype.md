I now have skype, I had to make my version of slackware multi-lib enabled to make it work, but now it works great. No one call me on it yet because I haven't gotten the headset, so you wont be able to hear me.
Also, I changed the avatars on this site to be cute little monsters, why? Because it's funny, that's why. Don't be offended, and NO you cannot change to some other monster, they were assigned randomly.
