For a long time now I have had a love hate relationship with the Linux media player <a href="http://banshee-project.org/download/archives/1.0.0/">Banshee</a>. When it comes to music and media players the KDE super champ <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> has no egual, but it's mainly a KDE app and it has some minor issues when running in Gnome, which is my prefered desktop under Ubuntu. Of the native Gnome media players there is the retarded Rhythmbox, which is so far behind it actually thinks its ahead, and the visionary Banshee, but the developers at <a href="http://banshee-project.org/download/archives/1.0.0/">Banshee </a>need to get their heads out of their collective asses, a very important feature (podcast downloads) was totally broken in the 1.4.1 release, and not only did it escape their attention, it was broken in 1.4.2 as well, after I reported the bug I was told they had found the problem and it would be fixed in 1.4.3, so a major feature only takes two release cycles to fix. RE...TAR...DED. Although I do have to hand it to them they are light years ahead of Rhythmbox, and it seems that Amarok is about ready to totally abdicate its lead with all the laughable modifications planned for Amarok 2.0. I guess Microsofts habit of totally f***ing up everything they had going for them has rubbed off on the open source community as well, all the media player software developers are stumbling all over themselves to make something that looks like iTunes, but fubar's everything that made them good as Linux apps.

If you plan to try Amarok 2.0, please remember that you need KDE 4.1 or higher to run it.

Another thing that immensely pisses me off is that Ubuntu has dropped Nvidia support, seemingly altogether in 8.10 Intrepid Ibex, which made me do a hasty retrograde install back to Hardy Heron, and has started me compiling my own lean Slackware derivative with a gnome desktop, I can't believe they left thousands of users out in the cold like that, normally I have nothing but praise for Ubuntu, but they really screwed the pooch on this one.
