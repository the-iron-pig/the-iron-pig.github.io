There is nothing more hectic than moving. I start moving this Thursday and hopefully will be done on Saturday. I am writing. My short story "Cthulhu for Dummies" should be done within a month, and work still moves forward on my novel "The Snakes of Terra". I am back to Slackware, I am now convinced that Ubuntu is just Windows Vista with a theme change. It was smooth for a while, but then it started getting unstable and crashing just like windows. If you like math, linux, and humor of questionable taste then you need to see the hilarious webcomic I found called <a title="there's a velociraptor behind you" href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a>, who would have thought stick figures could have such character.
