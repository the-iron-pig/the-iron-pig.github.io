Tomorrow I am going to work, then to a farewell party for a co-worker at sushi bar, then going to play go, and then going to Las Vegas Sci-Fi center to see <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=133151833361717&amp;ref=mf">Someone's Knocking at the Door</a> I just love cheesy horror/Sci-Fi movies, and this one looks like pure Velveeta.
