Well,
It appears that I have asthma. Don't know if this will be permanent, but I have an inhaler, and on the nicotine patch now. Very depressing. On  lighter note, I have been running into a lot of old friends lately, been reading some good books, finished my CIT152 midterm with an A, still have one more midterm for CIT181, but thats it's own can of worms. Can't wait for Thanksgiving, but even happier that its now Hot Tea weather in Vegas.<img src="http://www.woh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/108-254x300.jpg" alt="108" title="108" width="254" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-295" />
