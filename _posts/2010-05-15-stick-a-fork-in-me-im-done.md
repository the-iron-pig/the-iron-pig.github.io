Wow, finished all my finals, pulled two A's, graduating monday, Phi Theta Kappa Honors, High Honors. 
I have a corporate challenge chess tournament tomorrow, expect to do pretty well at that. The next photos on this site should be of me getting a medal for chess, or My graduation photo, I am going to order extra copies of my graduation photo and make sure certain family members who did everything they could to stop me from finishing school get a copy. These certain family members needed me to fail because they need to believe that the system is rigged against them, and no amount of hard work can help you, well, I hope my small victory stings you, and you know who you are.
