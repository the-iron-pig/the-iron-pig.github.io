This is a test of my new software that lets me publish to my blog via my desktop. If you can read this...it works! if not, then lamentation and dismay. I can also add pictures, lets see how well that works...

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-234" title="347105" src="http://www.woh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/347105.png" alt="347105" width="190" height="110" />

if that worked you should see that I am linux registered user #347105.

<strong>I wonder what this button does...oh, it puts my text in bold.</strong>

<em>This buttons seems to make things italian...I mean italic.</em>
