Well, my fathers mother, Jesse Dillard died today. I am filled with mixed emotions, she and I never had good communication, and it's hard for me to think of the good things concerning her, she hurt me so much, and hindered me so much, it's hard to be forgiving. After all is said and done though, I hope you find your way to the light grandma.
