When you get a new cool mini-computer, do not continually install and re-install different versions of Linux on it hoping to improve it...you improved the last one so much it stopped working. For those of you who know that I installed Debian on a Cenovo Mini PC, the install went wonderfully, it worked great, and FAST. No audio or Wireless, but those would be fixed in time. I tried to install openSUSE on hoping it's hardware support would be better, but instead it flashed the roms and wiped out my BIOS. So I am trying to get an exchange, all the way from China, boy this should be fun.

in Python programming, the command that you can never seem to remember to bring up the native ide environment is:

<code>idle</code>

it is so simple that you keep forgetting it.
