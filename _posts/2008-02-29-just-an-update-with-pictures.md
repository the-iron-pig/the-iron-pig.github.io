This is another one of my crazy co-workers, Emily, she had a pimple...

This is the smarter and wiser half of JK

This is a picture of the smartest and cutest and bestest dog in the whole wide world, her name is Courtney, and she's a very good girl.

I have spent a lot of time taking care of her, some terrible things happened to her, she got lost for a couple of weeks, and when we found her some kids had cornered her in an alley and  and were throwing bottles at her, we rescued her, and then she was attacked savagely by a pitbull who ripped a lot of her back out, she still wakes up sometimes having nightmares about it, she yelps and tries to get the dog off of her and I have to calm her down...it's sad, and it's even sadder that there are actually people in the world sick enough to do that kind of thing to animals for fun, there's a very <b><i>SPECIAL</i></b> place waiting in eternity for you <b>assholes.</b>
