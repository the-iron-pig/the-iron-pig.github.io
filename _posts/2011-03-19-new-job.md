I am no longer a cab driver, that job was a scam and a boondoggle, I don't think I made more than $150 on my best week there.
I have found a much better job as a purchasing agent for an electronics supply house and distributor. The people are friendly,  and I'm learning pretty quickly. It's definitely a step up from the last job.
I have been seeing a very nice guy for the past three months, we met on 1/1/11, which could turn out to be a very interesting anniversary. His name is Joe. My relationships usually only last a few months, and we've already broken the record, and he shows no signs of losing interest, so things are looking good. I'm spending less time on the computer, more time out in the world, and writing more. All around I think my life is getting better.
