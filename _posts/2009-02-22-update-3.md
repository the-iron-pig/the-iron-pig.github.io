Just trying to get through, busy with school and my CompTIA class and SQL language, doing a database project at work,  and incidentally there is nothing more depressing than waking up to a news story about dozens of chinese coal miners being buried alive.  Having that as your first thought of the day can change your perspective on some things.

I went to ACI yesterday, and then went to a co-workers birthday/housewarming, which was a nice break. Also on the lighter side I have finally managed to sample all the wierd drinks at the Asian Supermarket, there's something fun about getting a strange container with nothing but chinese writing on it and you dont even recognize the picture of the fruit thats on the label and drinking it anyway. On the whole most of them were good, but in general they were all too sweet, like drinking syrup, a lot of them were very good however, I think I particularly liked the aloe drinks.

Staying in today and doing homework, laundry and cleaning.
