These guys are hands down the BEST tattoo &amp; piercing place in Las Vegas. The shop owner and main artist "Texas" was one of the coolest dudes I ever met, and a wizard with the needles. I was a little scared about getting a tattoo but he made me feel at ease, was very professional and friendly and the tattoo came out looking BEAUTIFUL, and it didn't even hurt. Then I got piercings from their new guy Danny who was just as awesome. If you live in Vegas or are visiting, and want to know the best quality tattoo parlor in Vegas at the best prices, then you want Kats like US tattoos.
