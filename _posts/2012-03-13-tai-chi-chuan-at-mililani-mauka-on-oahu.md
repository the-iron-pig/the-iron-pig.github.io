I have found an amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T'ai_chi_ch'uan">T'ai Chi Ch'uan </a>class for FREE!! It's in Mililani twice a week. It is taught by Master Herbert Pong and his more senior students. It is twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday. Wednesday classes are at 9:00 am, sharp, at 
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Holanailii+Park,+Mililani,+HI+96789&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=21.438459,-158.023717&amp;spn=0.005023,0.006899&amp;sll=21.451331,-158.015281&amp;sspn=0.080364,0.110378&amp;oq=h&amp;hq=Holanailii+Park,+Mililani,+HI+96789&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A">Holanailii Park</a> in Mililani, HI. The Saturday classes are also at 9:00 am, but at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Mililani+Mauka+Park+and+Ride,+Ukuwai+Street,+HI+96789&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=21.468386,-158.003097&amp;spn=0.005022,0.006899&amp;sll=21.438459,-158.023717&amp;sspn=0.005023,0.006899&amp;oq=park+&amp;hq=Mililani+Mauka+Park+and+Ride,+Ukuwai+Street,+HI+96789&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A">Park &amp; Ride in Mililani Mauka</a>. The class is not too strenuous, wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. Even though the class is free, you will be expected to register, and sign in on following classes, and bring a few bucks with you because they occasionally have excellent deals on training manuals,T-shirts, cd's and dvd's etc. There are easily 50+ students at a time, of all ages, and the class is broken up into three groups by skill levels, <em>beginners</em>, <em>advanced</em> and <em>very advanced</em> students, so no matter what your skill level you are sure to fit in. Come out to enjoy the beautiful Hawai'i sky and air, and learn  T'ai Chi Ch'uan from one of the islands most revered Masters of the Art.
