I found this quotation today, it is attributed to an unknown source. I invite you to read it, then pause, and contemplate it. I think it is a thing of rare beauty and truth.


<pre><code>We will invent new lullabies, new songs, new acts of love,
we will cry over things we used to laugh &amp;
our new wisdom will bring tears to eyes of gentile
creatures from other planets who were afraid of us till then &amp;
in the end a summer with wild winds &amp;
new friends will be.

--unknown source.</code></pre>
