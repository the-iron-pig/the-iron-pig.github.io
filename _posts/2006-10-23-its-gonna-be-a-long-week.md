I don't know exactly when, how, or why it happened, but I'm addicted to my weekly worship, and something feels so very wrong now. I used to meditate often in Buddhist fashion, but being with my Quaker friends just seems different, it's like somehow we truly are together, that our collective worship and silence somehow really does bring us closer to each other, and to God. Each first day I go to worship, and feel more centered, and relieved, it really does give me strength to get through the week. Because of a lot of circumstances, I didn't get to go to worship this week, and it's first day night, and I already feel worn out. It's gonna be a long week.
