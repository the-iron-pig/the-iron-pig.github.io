Well, many people have resolutions for the new year, and I'm no different. When I quit smoking I gained a lot of weight, so now I'm going on a diet, don't plan to stop until I reach 200, which is 90 lbs away, at my best rate I have lost 5 lbs per week, so it should take me 18 weeks,Â  which, if everything goes according to schedule, should be in mid-May, but I'm giving myself till July. I have had a lot of addictions, and it has been a struggle to overcome many of them, and I'm throwing a few more of those out now too.

The coming semester that starts on the 17th will be the last I need to complete to get my Certificate of Database Administration, so hopefully I will have that under my belt soon too.

I have decided that 2010 will be the year of the beard, I normally hate facial hair, but am trying to grow one. Right now it looks like the kind of beard you see on a 13 year old boy, maybe I need hormone supplements or something.

Once the weather gets a little warmer I am going back to bike riding to and from work.

For those of you who have been monitoring my quitting smoking, yes I did cheat, and almost immediately had an asthma attack. So I guess there really is no going back. I suppose that's a good thing, except I actually enjoyed smoking, I know it's bad for me, and that this is better, but it feels a little unfair, but I will get over that soon, a death by wheezing and gasping for air is too horrible for me to go through a second time, since I had to watch my grandmother die that way.

So, weight, beard, no smoking, a few less addictions, oh, and I've decided that i am going to start planning and preparing for a backpacking trip in Asia, possibly China, maybe Tibet, still not sure when, or how, but I know that I have been cheated of too many of my plans, and I'm only getting older, and I want to see some of this planet before I have to leave it, so I am going to make it happen.

Here is a cool bug picture...
