2020 was quite an ordeal. I know that we are not completely out of the woods yet, but I am reminded of the word of Kilgore Trout from the novel Timequake by Kurt Vonnegut. <br>
 
<div style="text-align: center;"> “You were sick, but now you're well again, and there's work to do.”

― Kurt Vonnegut (Kilgore Trout, Timequake</div> <br>
I think there is a special wisdom in these words that will help us all reach the light at the end of the tunnel.
