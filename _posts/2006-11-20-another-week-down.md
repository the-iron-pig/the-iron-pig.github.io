Another week down, and Thanksgiving is coming soon. I got put in charge of making duplicate keys for my church, evidently some strange people have been coming around the church meeting and watching the children, asking for money etc. I watched Bride of Frankenstien this morning, great movie, it has so many powerful icons in it, and yet it seemed off center somehow, like they couldn't decide if they wanted the monster to be hated or loved. The hermit scene is timeless. No matter how great and iconic, that was a crappy ending, the monster lets his creator escape with the love of his life while he destroys himself along with the Bride (who rejected him) and Dr. Protius, he screams "Go! Live!" to Dr. Frankenstien, and then throws the doomsday switch... Lame. I get Thursday and Friday off with pay, was thinking of going to Idaho to see Jeff, still not sure about that though, on many levels. I need to consider carefully though, I'm running out of friends pretty quickly now that I have kicked Kristin to the curb.
