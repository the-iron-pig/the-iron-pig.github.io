Today we went to Brandon's house in Ko'Olina for thanksgiving, stuffed ourselves on some excellent food, and then went down to Paradise Cove after to snorkel. I have never been in the Ocean before and was amazed at how salty it was. I saw amazingly colored fishes, but the highlight of my day was the Sea Turtle, he was enormous, came right over by me, so I started to swim along side him for a while, at points he would meander closer to me out of curiosity, and then wander back out, and then eventually he took off for the deeper ocean and I went back in to shore, it was awesome, and I will always remember it. I love living in Hawaii.
