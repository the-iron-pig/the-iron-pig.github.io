It seems that the Nevada DMV has decided to give itself yet another unscrupulous raise. During the last year the NVDMV has adopted (intentionally?) the policy of sending renewal tags to old addresses, I know this practice is not just an office mix up because the last time they did this to me they sent it to an address I hadn't lived at in over 5 years even though I had updated my address with them to my current one the same year. When you go into their office, to fix this situation, they apologize and tell you they can fix all of it if you would be willing to pay a $5.00 additional paperwork fee, I was mad as a nest of hornets, but agreed. Then I started hearing from friends, family, and co-workers about the same thing happening to them, and I knew it was a state sanctioned scam, that cuts in the DMV's favor to the tune of $5.00 per citizen, quite a nifty under the radar tax.

Well, now the kind folks at the NVDMV are at it again, with the instatement of the new policy that you must get a new drivers license every time you get a new address. Usually if you moved all you would have to do is update the info with the DMV and they would send you a sticker to put on the back of your license. It seems however, that the evil genius who brought us the "$5.00 paperwork fee" has discovered that the average Las Vegas resident changes addresses once per year, and correctly reasoned that the NVDMV was losing money by issuing licenses that were good for 4 years, by unilaterally changing this policy the state of Nevada has quadrupled their income from drivers license fees.Â  Something is rotten in the Denmark of the NVDMV folks, we need to do something, soon.
