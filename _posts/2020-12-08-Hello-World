So far Christmas seems really nice this year. Usually I don't feel great around this time of year but this one seems nice. I got a cool new gamer keyboard and chair. Levelling up in Stardew Valley, kissed Sebastiasn for the first time. My family and freinds all seem to be doing ok. I think this Xmas might be ok!
