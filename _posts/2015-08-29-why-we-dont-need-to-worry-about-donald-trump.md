Trump will never be elected. I hear about it in my workplace, and on the radio and in the news, and perhaps deep down Democrats feel a cold twinge of fear at the notion that the Tea Party along with Republicans might actually be willing to wreck our government by electing Trump as punishment for our having elected Obama, but fear not, this is an empty threat, because:
<ol>
	<li>Trump polls very well, he puts all other Republican candidates in the dust, but this is not something to worry about, because polling well and getting elected are not the same thing, especially when you consider that being able to manipulate the media to put the spotlight on himself is his superpower. He will poll well from now until the end of time.</li>
	<li>America will not elect a 1-percenter, and definitely not a 1-percenter of the 1-percent. Obscene wealth, and the legal loopholes used to preserve that wealth are part of the main reason Mitt Romney couldn't get elected. Even when the economy is in serious trouble, American's won't elect someone who is that out of touch with the real world.</li>
	<li>Industrialists do not, and cannot function well in a political environment. You cannot run a Country the same way you would run a Company or Corporation. For example, suppose X% of Arkansas students can't read above a 3rd grade level, in a business, you would fire those poor performers, but it turns out that doesn't really work in the real world, and that we have to find a way to get those kids to read better, even when it will cost more. This is one of the main reasons Ross Perot could not get elected. Likewise, smear campaigns and bankruptcy are perfectly legitimate business strategies, and Trump has made use of both on multiple occasions, but they don't work in government, for example, you can't bankrupt your Army.</li>
	<li>Succeeding in business requires unilateral authority, and you just don't have that in American politics, our system is predicated against it.</li>
	<li>Business men do not have allies, they only have one-night-stands with allies. This is a fairly well-known and universal fact, and Trump is very blatant about the fact that if you cross him (or he just thinks you have crossed him) he will turn on you like a Cobra. It is for this reason that most Republicans are actually afraid of aligning with Trump. For further proof see 'Megyn Kelly'.</li>
	<li>Success in business does not translate into success in other areas, many times, success in business does not guarantee other successes in business. See 'Steve Jobs'. You can't elect business men to politics for much the same reason you can't elect academics, because the way they see the world isn't flexible enough. See 'President Taft'.</li>
</ol>
Ambrose Bierce brilliantly said, "Corporation: An ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility." Trump <em>literally is</em> a Corporation.

Ultimately, you cannot use Money as the yardstick of success in your Society, you don't want a Society built by the lowest bidder, you want the very best Society that you can afford. When your child has cancer, you don't want to the cheapest doctor you can find, you want the best doctor you can afford. Trump does not measure success that way. When all the dust settles, we will see Trump for what he is, he is a manifestation of discontent with our current system, he gives voice to anger about immigration and the economy, but at the end of the day, this is not a person you want to have the Nuclear Codes.
