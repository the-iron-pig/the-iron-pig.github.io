Thanks to Hollywood, all of us have had a sneaking suspicion that high ranking, high powered government agencies have incredible powers to track down and find people thanks to computers and the information age. To some extent this has led to a begrudging acceptance of the fact that if the government really wanted to, they could hack your phone, or read your emails, and to a large extent we are glad that the people who fight bad guys have these amazing powers. We like to believe that the best hackers in the world work for us. But in light of Edward Snowden's revelation about NSA snooping there are some things that are a part of ordinary American life that you are going to have to think twice about now.
The NSA, and POTUS have gone on record saying that they only collect metadata, which for the most part seems to be true (at least for now). As someone who got a degree in Database Administration I can tell you that a collection of metadata can only serve one purpose, it can only serve as an index, to help you refine your search of a larger set. So the basic idea is that you use the metadata to come up with a list of suspicious individuals who have unusual or targeted information behavior, ie. they get calls from suspicious numbers or have encrypted traffic, and once you have that list of suspects, then you can search a larger, and more elaborate information system for really incriminating evidence, ie. recorded calls, emails, etc.
So metadata in and of itself is not incredibly useful or incriminating, but becomes extremely useful when you have a larger set of data to parse ie. the actual phone recordings and emails of all Americans, so it seems likely that the collection of metadata in huge amounts indicates that the NSA or some secret co-operative branch does in fact have a larger and more detailed store of information (your entire digital record of everything you have ever done on phone or internet).
What you need to be considering now, in light of all these revelations from Snowden and Manning, is how ordinary things that are a part of American life today will now have changed and be monitored.

1.) Sexting - If you have ever sent a naked pic of yourself to anyone, in the last two years or so, that image and that phone record, is now in some government database somewhere, and that record will probably be stored for decades.

2.) Booty Call-If you have ever texted someone or called someone, saying that "yes, I am horny, come over right now." That text or call is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come.

3.) If you were ever in a place that you shouldn't have been, or have lied about being at, ie. you were at a bachelor party, strip club, brothel, getting a massage, meeting an "EX", your location, and exact times you were at that location, is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come.

4.) If you have ever rented an "Adult" video, that record is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come.

5.) The NSA now knows your sexual preference and knows exactly how kinky you are. Since they record all traffic to your computer, it doesn't matter if you are using "privacy" mode, or clear your search history and clear your cookies, if an adult video has been viewed on your computer, that record is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come. If you have ever googled something kinky ie. "two girls one cup", the NSA knows you googled it.

6.) They have a reasonably good chance of knowing every computer and every phone you have ever used. simply by the fact that you check your yahoo or google email from a work computer, or friends computer, they know where your work is, and who your friend is.

7.) Drunk-dial/email - If you have ever sent and email or text that you regretted later, for whatever reason, that record is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come.

8.) File-sharing/Illegal Copyright violations if you have ever used Kazaa, Bittorrent, Gnutella, The Piratebay, ISOhunt, etc to download ANYTHING, music, video, ebooks etc. then that record is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come. (so don't think you got away with it, they could still bust you five years from now.)

9.) Keyword violations if your emails, texts, or phone calls contain a keyword violation, ie. "Osama bin laden" or "al-Qaeda" or "Terrorism" not only is that record is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come, but you are now on a more exclusive list of information, that needs personal attention of a designated government agent.

10.) <em>They now know everything</em> - if you have ever cheated on your wife, if you have ever cheated on your taxes, if you have ever written to a friend about your stress level or psychological problems, if you have ever emailed your Doctor about a strange growth or burning sensation when you pee, that record is now in a government database, and will be for decades to come.

Pretty much every keystroke you have ever made in the last few years, either on phone or keyboard or ATM, has been recorded, and can be compared against a larger database of more specific information to determine virtually EVERYTHING about you.
Now, how much of this information can be used against you in a court of law is a matter for the courts to decide, and of course, will also be decided by the amount of public outrage.
There was a very good scene from the classic movie "Seven" starring Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, in which the investigating detectives illegally used library records to find their suspect, and they knew they couldn't use that information in court, and they were fine with that, because it helped them find the bad guy, so the ultimate point is, how much information and power do you want your government to have?
Can you handle facing a government official across a table, and find yourself wondering if they know about your naked pic? If they know you rented that movie that one time? If they know about that really kinky thing you did that one time? It doesn't matter if they are allowed to use it against you in court or not, but does it bother you that they know it anyway?
