You know, I have heard it said, often, that "there is nothing new under the Sun", and that could be possible, but our understanding of our world and our place in it is not etched in stone. In fact, each of us sees the world uniquely, and we understand it differently. If you took two people, and had them read and experience the same book, the two stories they experience are quite different. My answer to the people who say that "there is nothing new under the Sun" is that "a man cannot set foot in the same river twice". The typical view of that anecdote is that the reason a man cannot set foot in the same river twice is that all the water has changed, and hence it is a new river, but I think this anecdote is true for another reason, that man is a river as well, moving through time, changing with every new turn or bend and each new increase in understanding, so the anecdote is doubly true, not only because the river is changing, but because the man is not the same man from moment to moment. So there is something new under the Sun after all, the way we see, and re-see our world.
