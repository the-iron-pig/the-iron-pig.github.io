I have really been hoping this series would get better, and that the fine folks at <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/">Dark Horse Comics</a> would take my advice about improving this series, but no such luck. This issue is 18 pages, 7 of which are double sided full page ads, not counting the covers that gives this issue an advertisment ratio of 39%, which means $1.36 of the cover price I paid for this issue was me PAYING to see ads, not to mention the cost to story content. They laid the ground for some back story, did some minor characterisation, and one plot tease, other than that the only actual actions performed in this issue are the main android character performing 3-4 downloads and blowing up a few aliens. The blowing up aliens part was neither exciting nor did it serve the plot in any way, they just had to have an obstacle to fill pages and it technically is an Aliens comic, so why not use Aliens as the obstacles? So in that respect this series successfully imitates a pulp aliens comic. We are 50% done with this series, and not even a hint of talent, I really wanted this series to be good, but all <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/">Dark Horses'</a> effort with this series are self-aborting. The material in this plot isnt even suitable to be filler in their next Aliens Omnibus. Go Ahead and skip it, you aren't missing a damn thing.
