Ray Bradbury's "The Martian Chronicles" is still one of the greatest books ever written in English.  I especially like the  Insane Asylum story, The Hot Dog Stand on Mars story, and my favorite The Small American Town on Mars story. Do yourself a favor and get this book. Bradbury is a genius, he perfectly and timelessly expresses that in the entire universe, there is no alien quite as strange as the ones right here on Earth.
