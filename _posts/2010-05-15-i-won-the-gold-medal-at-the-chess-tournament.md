Corporate Challenge Chess 2010-Division D-"The Team" wins gold. Dave Hewetson, Brandon Kellman, Jason K, and myself took first place, with a flawless record. The final match was very intense and difficult, I was down a knight and a bishop, then I lost the other knight, but in a total upset he fell for my trap, giving up his rook and bishop in back to back moves, which gave me the material lead I needed to turn the game around, I promoted a pawn to Queen, and took control of the final game. I was sweating bullets, didn't want to be the one who blemished our flawless win record, but in the end I pulled it out. It was awesome.
