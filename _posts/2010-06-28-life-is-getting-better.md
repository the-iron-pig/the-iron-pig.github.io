Over the past few years my life has consistently been improving, I'm finding that I'm more outgoing, friendlier, motivated, and happier. For a long time I was angry that my life wasn't what I wanted it to be, I felt that I had been unfairly derailed into some random life that wasn't my choosing, but I realized that I was wanting life to be something it couldn't be. My therapist brought up a very good point, and I have come to understand it, life doesn't get any better than setting goals, and working towards them, it doesn't matter if they are large or small, or if your progress is fast or slow, tallying up goals is a happy life. And I thought I was sooo far ahead of the curve (despite the fact that I began this sentence with a preposition) but all I had done was manage to estrange myself from the simple joys of my own life. Now things are getting better, and I've met a wonderful person. I have felt very attracted to the Buddhist ideas of impermanence, mostly because I never felt anything in life was lasting, or real, but for the first time in..well..forever, I feel real, I feel like I am here, and whats more...I want to be here.
