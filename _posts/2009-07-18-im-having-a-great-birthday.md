Today has been great! Best 38th birthday ever. First I went to sushi at yama with 5 friends from work. Then my friends wished me happy birthday and the sushi chefs heard it, and so they made me a special sushi plate and prepped up a Saki-Bomb fro us all to drink, and then everyone in the sushi bar joined together to sing happy birthday to me, it was awesome! here is the pic of the sushi bomb before they tipped it...

and as some of you may know, I am a bug fanatic, and I got some insect clip art as a gift today, and so I am going to post bug pictures with posts in the future, just because I like bugs. This is one of my favorites, a glorious beetle...

it's been a really good birthday so far, and I still am meeting Tom tonight for Peking Duck, which is my favorite food of all.
