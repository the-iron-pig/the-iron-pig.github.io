If the postal service isn't lying, then my new mini-computer/tv box should be arriving. The first thing I plan to do is go through the process of installing Debian 8.2.0 Jessie on its bad little self.

In case you don't know what that is, check it out here <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_187681.html">http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_187681.html </a>evidently it comes with dual boot Android and Windows 8.1, I don't so much mind the Android, but I cannot abide windows, so, as I said above, that will be remedied almost as soon as I get it.
