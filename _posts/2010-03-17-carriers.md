I heard good things about the straight to DVD release thriller movie <a href="http://www.carriersmovie.com/">Carriers</a>, so I rented it from <a href="http://www.redbox.com">redbox</a>, and was not dissappointed, this is not a typical virus apocalypse movie, it is full of intense drama, much in the fashion of <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/crown/worldwarz/">Max Brooks World War Z</a>, where the writers take the approach of exploring the impact of what survival means in a post-apocalyptic world, and how it affects you, and your relationship to other people. This approach proved to be genius in World War Z, and it looks like the writers of Carriers took note, because this is a very good movie, even though it is low budget, it is excellently acted, I give it an 8.2/10.
