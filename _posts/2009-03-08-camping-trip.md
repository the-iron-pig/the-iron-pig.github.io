<p style="text-align:center;">I just got back from my camping trip to Valley of Fire, took a few hikes, saw the Beehives, Rainbow Vista, took a class at the visitor center on the Dinosaur species that were prevalent in the area millions of years ago, cooked my meals over an open flame, and spent some time with my good friends Kade and his wife Emily. I did a lot of petroglyph hunting, so I have a lot of photos of those for you guys.</p>
