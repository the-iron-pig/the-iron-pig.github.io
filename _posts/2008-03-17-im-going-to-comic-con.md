I was hoping to go to Denvention3 in Denver CO this year but they closed the HUGO voting tickets and jacked up their prices to $160/night, so I said F*** YOU Denver, I don't care if you're the world's biggest Sci-Fi Convention or not, you can't price out the ordinary guy. Anyway, I decided to replace it with another vacation instead, San Diego Comic-Con, it's the week of my birthday, it's by the ocean, and I have two friends there I can hang with.
