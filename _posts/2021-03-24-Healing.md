So I have been trying a new method of mind training where you access the power of your unconscious mind. Each night as you fall asleep you ask your dreaming mind to work on a problem you want to solve. The problem I have been asking is "how do I fall in love with my life again"? and it has been working and I have awoken each day with one more piece of the puzzle solved. But now I have hit a wall, a sort of blank section of the puzzle in which I have realized that I am not completely whole yet as a person and that there is a great deal of self healing I need to do before I launch off into a new life of Amor Fati. So now the assignments I am giving my unconscious mind are about how best to heal myself and cope with the gaps in my past. I feel a change in myself that is hard to describe, except that I can tell you that for the first time in a long time I feel hopeful. I am tired of feeling tired. No matter how much sleep I get I still feel tired, looking forward to this change.
