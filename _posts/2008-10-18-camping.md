I just got back this morning from camping. I wanted to go to <a title="VoF" href="http://parks.nv.gov/vf.htm">Valley of Fire</a> but wouldn't you know it, all the sites were booked, which made me angry since it's supposed to be first come first served basis, so I went 40 miles into the park to get to the Boulder Beach campground, which is very nice and right on a beach, I had almost finished setting my tent when a ranger came and told me that my spot was also reserved, which made me livid. Every other spot had traffic cones blocking them "for water pipe maintenance" which turned out to be a lie since it was actually a large groups way of reserving spots for their friends. I was furious. I finally went to Las Vegas Bay campground, which was empty, until I setup my camp, then cars came in in <em>droves</em>. Despite everything I had a nice relaxing time, and did some good thinking. Clarified a lot of ideas for my writing, and am again making headway on my writing. I decided to make <strong>Snakes of Terra</strong> a collection of short stories like <a title="Kirinyaga" href="http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/kirinyaga.html">Mike Resnick's Kirinyaga</a> (which I <em>highly</em> recommend by the way), <strong>Cthulhu for Dummies</strong> is on a backburner since I'm not entirely sure about legality of copyright on some of the materials, which may actually put a damper on <strong>Cthulhu versus Mecha-Cthulhu. </strong>It is important to have pictures with your words in blogs these days, and I didn't take any pictures from my recent camping trip, so here's a freeciv screenshot.
