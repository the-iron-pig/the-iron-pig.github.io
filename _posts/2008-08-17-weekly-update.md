Well, the past month has been ridiculously expensive. My car broke down, and of course it wasn't a simple clutch problem, I had to replace the transmission housing as well, for a cost of $1500. Then I had to move, and of course, my old landlord isn't going to give me back my deposit (which was inordinately huge) because he says his partner ran off with it, and he feels that would be unfair to him to be asked to pay it back. I had to put down first and last on the new apartment. Then I had to have the root canal, which thank god, insurance covered, but I still had to pay a hefty co-pay. I've been living on microwave burritos and ramen for a month. It's expensive to be an American these days. I'm lucky I like to read, otherwise my entertainment expensies would really be suffering right now. I wanted to post a picture for this blog entry, but I don't really have anything exciting, so I'm just going to post a snapshot of my desktop, so without further ado, here is Will's desktop:
