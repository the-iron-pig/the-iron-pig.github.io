I have been working and trying to deal with family stress, but things are working out well. I thought I was in love a few months back, but then certain people turned out to get really really mean when pressure was put on. I need to be with someone who turns to me instead of away from me when the going gets tough, and they never gave me that chance, which broke my heart. I need to be with someone who doesn't crumble like a saltine when the screw get turned.
School starts in a few days, I wanted to spend the summer on my reading list, I purchased 12 philosophy books to read over summer, but at the last minute a summer course in my degree came open, so I only had a half-summer for reading. I bought a backpacking type pack for long hikes, looking forward to a chance to use it when the heat finally breaks. I just finished reading "The Spoon River Anthology" by Edgar Lee Masters, which was excellent in so many ways I can't even articulate it well here, it is a very deep, insightful, sad, and yet funny book that I highly recommend for anyone to read.
