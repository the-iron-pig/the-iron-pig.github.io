Well my bosses at work have announced that next friday is black friday. Someone is getting fired. I have no idea if it will be me or not, guess if it is me I had to move on sometime. I worked ACI certification test on Saturday morning, then went to copymax to print up 1000 flyers for <a href="http://vegasgoclub.googlepages.com/">my GO club</a>, then spent an hour cutting them down to size, even with 1/2 of a percent response that should be about 20 new members. After copymax I went out to sushi with James, we hung out a bit it the barnes and nobles, and then called it a day. I went to quaker worship this morning, and met some nice vistors from quaker church in New York, they seemed very nice. Visited mom, she's doing well, and she seems to like going to her physical therapy. My dad took his sea-doos out to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/lame/planyourvisit/hike.htm">Lake Mead</a> yesterday and it flipped over on him, his wallet, his gun, his keys, all his cards and ID are now on the bottom of Lake Mead somewhere, of course if the water level keeps dropping out there like it has been, soon he will be able to walk out and find them in the dirt. I have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-History-Donna-Tartt/dp/0449911519">The Secret History by Donna Tartt</a>, which is very good and well written, they tell you who killed bunny on the first page, and yet it is so compelling that you still want to keep reading.

Other than all that, I don't really think much is going on. Still single. It's still scorching hot, and wish the heat would finally break.
