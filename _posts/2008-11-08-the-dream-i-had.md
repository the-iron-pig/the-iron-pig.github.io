I had a dream the other night...

I was standing in a forest, I didn't particularly know where, I had a feeling I was close to some kind of University. I was walking and exploring, there was a cobblestone path...

As I explored the path and the forest I saw a brilliantly colored spider, I remember it being abnormally large, and its markings were dazzling, bright yellow with what seemed to be moving black patterns, almost like Rorschach patterns, it was so amazing to me that I had to try to catch it. It ran away, and as I chased after it it led me on, it was incredibly fast and dexterous, doing what seemed to be acrobatics through its zigzag path through the trees. It also seemed to be vocalizing or emoting some sort of joy as it did this. It gave me quite a run, finally I decided to try to trick it with a tree branch, but as I swatted the tree branch down on it and looked under to see my prize it whistled at me from behind me, it had tricked me. Finally, after some more chasing I caught it, although I think it may have let me catch it, and as I held it, it said to me that If I let I let it go it would show me more amazing things. "Like what?" I asked it.

"If you let me go I will take you to see the forest of walking trees." So I agreed, and it led me down another path through the forest. I came out of the forest at the end of the path, it was now night, and there was a massive full moon, and I stood at the base of a hill, covered in wet green grass. On the hill were four magnificent elephants, that were a magnificent dark grey color. The base of the hill had some kind of cobble stone wall around it, and there seemed to be bail hay stacked about on the hill. The enormous elephants were powerful and majestic, and I was awestruck...I was filled with a sense that they were from someplace very far away, that this was not their normal home, and that this was some kind of secret migration shortcut they used to travel around the world. There was a particularly large bull, who jumped up on his hind legs and brought his forelegs crashing down on the bail hay to smash it about, so him and his family could pick it up and eat it. At this point I began to wake up, but before I woke up I remembered there powerful trunk like legs, and made the connection, "Of course, the spider would think of them as walking trees." Then I woke up.
