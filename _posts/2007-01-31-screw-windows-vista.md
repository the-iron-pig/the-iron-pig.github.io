Screw Windows Vista, just how many times are you gonna follow these losers around the technology corner? Switch to Ubuntu Linux, its perfect, more stable, secure, easy to use with point and click apps just like windows, and its FREE!!! It finds my printers, my Ipod, plays my music, has filesharing, fast smooth DVD playing, and is immune to windows Viruses.
