I have been driving cab here in wonderful Las Vegas, so far it hasn't been very financially rewarding, even though I make good tips. Currently Las Vegas is in the middle of a cab territory war, where all the major companies are trying push and shove each other out of the market by flooding the market with cabs, one company doubles its number of cabs on the road, hoping to starve out other companies, and the other companies have to reply in kind to survive, the net result is that the drivers have fewer rides, make less money, and cab driving is no longer a livable wage job in Vegas. Despite this it is something to do and gives me a reason to get out of the house and talk to people, so I still do it. I had my red medallion shift yesterday and decided to get in there and fight the lines like everyone else, so made my way to the big casino lines and even managed to figure out the airport system. Here's a pic I took waiting in the queue at the aiprort.

I was a little nervous at first, but got over it quickly and was like a professional by the end of the day.
I saw an amazing British series called "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/">Sherlock</a>" that is a modernization of the famous Arthur Conan Doyle characters exploits, and I think it's the best thing I've seen all year, at least until the new season of "Doctor Who" comes out.<a href="http://woh3.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/sherlock1.jpg"><img src="http://woh3.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/sherlock1.jpg?w=212" alt="" title="sherlock" width="212" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-470" /></a>
 I have watched and re-watched these episodes and loved them every time, and found the happy news on the internet this morning that BBC has decided to produce a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29#Series_2_.282011.29">second season</a> (of three ninety minute episodes) that will air late 2011 (^_^)
I have been spending time with someone nice, he seems different than most my other relationships, hopefully this will go somewhere.
Also, i finally dumped t-mobile, and went with metroPCS, so far I am very happy with the phone, and the service, I am very very happy with the fact that they cost about $40 less per month than my t-mobile plan. The only drawback is that my phone doesn't have sudoku, which I kind of got addicted to playing 10-12 times per day while I was waiting for things. Now that I am temporarily without car and taking the bus and bike all over town i really miss my sudoku program. MetroPCS if you are listening you need to have more games for your phone platform, especially 'Platinum Sudoku' or 'Platinum Sudoku 2'. The phone is a nice samsung, which kind of reminds me of the HH2G so I immediately customized it with this wallpaper
