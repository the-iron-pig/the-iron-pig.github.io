Today is our meeting at Barnes and Noble bookstore on maryland parkway. It's going to be fun. We've had a lot of interest in this meeting. I've also been playing a lot of go online through IGS instead of my usual KGS. I put the GO playing robot back online for KGS in the Las Vegas Go Club Room. I usually post the pics of the club meetings over at the club website <a href="http://vegasgoclub.googlepages.com">Las Vegas Go Club</a> but since I am the President I will post todays meeting photo here as well just for the shear excitement of it.
Talk to you soon.
