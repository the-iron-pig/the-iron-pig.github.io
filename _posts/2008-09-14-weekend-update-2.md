Took off work early yesterday morning, trying to relax. Got up early this morning and went out to Lake Mead with James and showed him that we do in fact have water in this state. I found a really nice campground near the water that I never saw before, so I plan to go camping there when the weather finally cools down. We stopped at a scenic rest area and played some Go, lot's of cyclists were around. We came back into town, had lunch and hung out for a while. I made him copies of the walking dead comic series, and now I'm getting ready to relax and watch a movie. There isn't a whole lot happening, and that's the way I hope it stays all weekend.
