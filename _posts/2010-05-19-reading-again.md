At long last, I have some time for pleasure reading again. I am currently reading "Mathematicians in Love" by one of my favorite Science fiction Authors, <a href="http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/">Rudy Rucker</a>.

<a href="http://woh3blog.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/mathematicians_in_love.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-379" title="mathematicians_in_love" src="http://woh3blog.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/mathematicians_in_love.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="500" /></a>

I just love his crazy characters, his brilliant imagination when it comes to mathematics, and just his all around weirdness.  Now that I have some free time, I am practicing tai-chi, compiling code, and tinkering with databases just for fun. I figure, as long as I'm single, might as well enjoys it...er...wait...I wonder if this is WHY I'm single? Hmm, will have to think about that one.
