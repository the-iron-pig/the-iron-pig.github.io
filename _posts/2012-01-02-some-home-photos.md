There are an amazing variety of Birds and Lizards, and sometimes slugs that show up around here, we definitely live in the tropics...Joe's favorite thing by far out here is the birds, he goes nuts every time he sees some strange new bird. It seem to turn him into a kid again, and it makes me happy to see that happen, so I guess it's a win-win
