The funniest thing I saw all week, a TV weather man here in Las Vegas actually said on live television a remark to the effect of "the apocalypse may be coming soon", at which every other news anchor jumped to state "The apocalypse is not, repeat NOT coming" and the news caster was pretty much sacked on the spot, and it just made me think about how funny it is that our society really does believe the end is coming soon, and that the world really is teetering on the edge of the apocalypse. Trust me on this folks, if the world ends, it will be our own doing, not God. God loves us and this place we call home. I prefer to think of man custodianship of Earth as a test for us, like a parent who gives his child a small company to run to see what he does with it, will he make it prosper, or will he run it into the ground? I think just about everyone needs to seriously rethink what the bible said about man's dominion of Earth, some people think it's a licence to trash the place (not much point in saving a world already scheduled to be condemned IE Apocalypse), others of us think that the lines imply the awesome responsibility of custodianship.
