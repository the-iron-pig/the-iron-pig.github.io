I am a Geo-Technical Lab Manager in San Francisco California. I am working my way through list of all Star Wars books ever written. I like Birdwatching, Computer-Stuff, and Writing. I think that going to the Library should count as going to Church, although I am not an Atheist. I like to ride my bike too.

I have a Science Fiction book review site at <a href="https://scifibookreader.wordpress.com/">SciFiBookReader.com</a>
