<a href='http://abetterqueue.com/'>A Better Queue</a>.

Wow,
I am so glad I found this. I was honestly frustrated with Netflix and their suggestions. It seemed like there were fewer and fewer movies that I liked coming out, but with A Better Queue not only did I find out that there are actually a ton of movies I want to see, but they are already on Netflix, they just didn't know to suggest them to me. I was seriously thinking about cancelling Netflix since it never seemed to have what I wanted, now I have a whole month of things I can't wait to watch.
What a great tool!!
