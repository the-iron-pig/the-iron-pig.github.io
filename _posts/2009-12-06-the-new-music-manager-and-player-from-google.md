I just compiled and installed the music player "GOGGLES" by the people who work on open source projects at GOOGLE. I got tired of the over managed Linux distributions like red hat and Ubuntu, although they are excellent products and very good for beginners and general users, they lack the power and subtlety I prefer in a distro. I use Slackware64 13.0 and will never go back. Since I made the switch I have struggled with music players, the boneheads at Amarok have completely screwed the pooch on their new design, and taken a wonderful player and made it almost unusable. I tried the gnome alternatives like banshee and rhythmbox, which are fine, but riddled with problems like not being able to get album art or download podcasts. Then I found GOGGLES, and I would like to take this moment to praise the geniuses at Google for following the prime directive of open source technology, KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID. All the power and usability of this wonderful little program derives as a direct consequence of its simplicity. I recommend an immediate jettison of any other music player you have right now, go get the source code and compile this.

If you use windows, you may look at things like this and feel that you have been left out, and that the revolution has started without you, and you would be right.

<a href="http://code.google.com/p/gogglesmm/">Goggles</a> is still in development so does not have certain features yet like podcasts, but I still think its a better player, it's fast and light-weight, clean and smooth, supports ogg files, supports album art in an time when it is broken in most the major players like Amarok and Rhythmbox, and has a simple interface for LastFM
