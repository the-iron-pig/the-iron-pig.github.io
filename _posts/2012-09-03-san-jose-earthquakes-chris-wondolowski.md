I have become a huge Soccer fan lately, and just saw the great game today between San Jose Earthquakes and Chivas USA. Great game, and I noticed one of the better players of the Quakes was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wondolowski" target="_blank">Chris Wondolowski</a> who is an excellent player, but one of the things that struck me about him, and maybe this is just me, but I thought he had an uncanny similarity in appearance to the 80's gay porn superstar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Bread-Ecstasy-Death-Stefano/dp/1555833837" target="_blank">Joey Stefano</a>.

Here is a pic of Wondo...

and here is a pic of Joey...

it was pretty hard finding a G-rated pic of Joey for the comparison, so if you are so inclined, do a google image search comparing them. Most of the pics of Joey that had facial stubble really looked like Wondo, but they were pretty X-rated. Let me know what you guys think. Oh yeah, Hi Mom.
