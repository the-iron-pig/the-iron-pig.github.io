It just overwhelmingly beautiful out here, the weather is wonderful, the scenery is gourgeous and there is something amazing everywhere I turn. I wanted to take more time to absorb before I posted something here about it, but the only thing I can say is life seems like a completely different kind of thing here...I think Joe and I are going to like it here.
