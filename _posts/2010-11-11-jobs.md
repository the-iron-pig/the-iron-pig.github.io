Well there are some job prospects on the horizon. I passed the drug test for the cab company, and they scheduled me for my driving test this coming Monday, so if all goes well I will be a vegas cab driver soon. Not sure that's a great career, but could be interesting. One of my buddies who works for another lab here in town is trying to get me in with him over there, that would be very cool, but whatever happens i would like to have insurance again soon.
