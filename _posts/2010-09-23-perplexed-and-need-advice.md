I recently decided to try to fill the void in my life that Aikido used to fill by starting Judo. I spent 8 years doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido">Aikido</a>, and loved it, but stopped when my life went through a lot of changes, and never went back. I totally agree with the philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido">Aikido</a>, the only problem is, I don't entirely like the people it attracts. It has a tendency to attract a more elitist sort of person, which I have no doubt it why I was drawn to it in my earlier years, and the elitism was part of what repulsed me from it at the end. I am very drawn to the power and assertiveness that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo">Judo</a> has to offer, and have recently come to believe that those are qualities I have been seriously lacking in my life. My only reservations about Judo are that it attracts a very crude and gruff type of person, and I don't have 8 years invested in it. If anyone reads this, please weigh in and let me know, I am truly confused and on the fence.
