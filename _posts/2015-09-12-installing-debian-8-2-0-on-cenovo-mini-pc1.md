installation complete, it was fairly easy, but with a few minor hiccups. The Cenovo 64-bit Quad-core Mini PC (TV Box) does not seem to be able to handle Gnome for some reason, so the only desktop environment I could readily make function was XFCE. It seems that the audio is not detected, and the on-board wireless is not detected, which seems a little odd since Android 4.4 sees them fine. I will start working on those two issues now, and will post more info, pics and video of it running Debian as I get it more like a real Debian install. Apart from those minor issues, I am actually pretty happy with this little unit, it has a super fast boot, easily less than ten seconds, and it runs fast too. More to come later.
