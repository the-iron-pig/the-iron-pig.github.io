A GREAT place to have a BIG breakfast in Manteca, California. The average price of a breakfast here is $9 and change, and the food is delicious, with enormous portions. I had recently relocated from Hawaii, where there is no such thing as a big country breakfast, so when I ordered, I ordered a biscuits and gravy skillet and a side of pancakes, which was a mistake, since either one would have filled me up. The biscuits and gravy came with 3 eggs, 3 sausage, and hash brown that took up half the plate, was perfectly crispy and tasted as if it had been cooked up with bacon grease. I am always a hrash critic of biscuits and gravy, but these were wonderful, biscuits were fluffy and flavorful, the gravy was excellent with just the right amount of salt. It seems a little hard to find in a shopping center at 1471 W Yosemite Ave, Manteca, CA 95337
