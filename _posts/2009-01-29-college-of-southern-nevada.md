<a href="http://www.csn.edu/">The College of Southern Nevada</a> offers many online classes, but they don't tell you that they have a Microsoft requirement. I am taking an SQL concepts class online with them, but they should just call the class Microsoft Server 2008 concepts, because that's all it is. I have complained to the school and the instructor, but none of them care, and I'm wondering if this is legally actionable. We live in the age of the <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/01/24/225235">Downadup virus</a>, which has something like 8% of all windows PC's in its grip globally, but hay, I'm the crazy one for insisting on an OS that has slightly more security than a screen door.
