I went to my very first "<a href="http://www.firstfriday-lasvegas.org/">First Friday</a>" event in downtown Las Vegas yesterday, it was great fun, with a lot of cool art, and I got to meet some old friends that I did not know were exhibiting there. I was planning to go see a fellow church members band at the Box Office, but that was way downtown and I got stuck right around the Charleston and Strip area where all my friends were exhibiting, mainly I was at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/artsoul">PeaceNArt Studio</a> of <a href="http://www.alexanderphuerta.com/">Alex Huerta</a> who is rapidly becoming a major mover and shaker in the downtown art scene, it was good to see him again after so long, then we had a Mexican food dinner, and met for drinks beforehand at <a href="http://www.frankiestikiroom.com/index.html">Frankie's Tiki Room</a>, which was just awesome, it really looks like something right out of Gilligan's island in there, and I had my first <a href="http://www.frankiestikiroom.com/drinks.html">Thurston Howell</a> drink, it was tasty, and a lot stronger than it looked.
