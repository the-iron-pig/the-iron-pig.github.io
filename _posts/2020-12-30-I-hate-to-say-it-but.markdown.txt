I, like many people, am very tired of the coronavirus and all the problems it brought with it this year.
The general rhetoric seems to be "I am can't wait until 2020 is over" but what they really mean to say is
they can't wait for this pandemic to be over. Now as we approach the New Year in a day or so we are
now getting more reports of an even more virulent strain of coronavirus has been discovered in the U.K.
and last night I heard on the news about the first confirmed case of this new virulent strain here
in the U.S.. It seems that the outlook for at least the first part of 2021 is going to be a bleak one. 
Hopefully the vaccines will work and everyone will get them. I hope that the last half of 2021 can be
semi-normal.
