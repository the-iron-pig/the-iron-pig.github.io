Having a pretty good weekend so far, I got all moved into my new place, and now I'm learning about all it's little quirks. I have a nice view of the mountain, which I like a lot better than seeing the city. I went out with some co-workers and played bocce ball, which was great, and my team won. Thomas is still away visiting his family, about 11 days to go till he comes back. I aced my summer web programming class, and signed up for fall semester, only taking two classes, cit 181, which is a class on oracle databases, and cit 152, which is advanced web scripting. I hope it includes php, and is not some lame ass course on javascript, which isn't even real java. And now it's time for a cool bug photo...
