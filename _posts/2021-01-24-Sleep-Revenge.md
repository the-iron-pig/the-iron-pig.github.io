I recently found out about the phenomenon know as <a href="https://greatist.com/discover/revenge-bedtime-procrastination">Sleep Revenge</a> that is something I suffer from. 
I think I may be having a midlife crisis. I have to take a ton of meds for my sleep problems and nerve pain problems and right around midnight when my pills are really kicking in is when my ind seems to come alive and I want to pursue my interests, even though I am not entirely sure what they are. I can't decie between chess, art, computer programming or getting ahead at work. This is frustrating. I need to focus my energies but I just don't know what to focus on.
