I competed yesterday in a Magic the Gathering Worldwake pre-release tournament here in Las Vegas at <a title="Little Shop of Magic" href="http://www.shopofmagic.com/">The Little Shop of Magic</a>.

My friends Bob Ching and Ian Roach went with me. We had a great time, Ian won his booster draft, and I did better than I ever have in a sealed deck tournament.

I put together a White and Blue Ally deck with a splash of Green, Ian and Bob told me the splash of Green was a mistake, and they were right so I took it out and it was good advice. There were several games where I thought I was a goner, and then I top-decked my game-breaking card "Lorthos the Tidemaker"

<p style="text-align:left;">his ability to lock down permanents turned the game around for me just as I was at the brink, several of my opponents felt robbed. I was 3-0 going into my 4th round where I suffered my first defeat. It later turned out that the guy I lost to was a World Tour Pro Player, and I still do not believe that he got the cards he was playing with in the sealed deck tournament, and I mean that literally, I don't believe he actually got those cards. So I won my next match after him to give me 4-1 going into the final round where my opponent and I decided to draw so we could both get into the top 16 elimination rounds, so I was 4-1-1 going into the 3 rounds of single elimination for the top 16 player. I won my first game, lost the second, but won the tie-breaker round to give me 5-1-1, and then, to my horror, in the second round of single elimination I was paired once again with the cheater World Tour Pro player with the amazingly perfect deck, and he knocked me out the second round. I believe my standing was 6 out 62 players, which is not bad. I finally managed to get some good rares that I have been looking for for a long time, I got Sorin Markov to complete my Vampire Deck.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">During booster draft I hate drafted a Novablast Worm which comes with a built in wrath of god every time it attacks. It helped me to get over the sting of my final round defeat that I opened my prize packs and got...</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">which is currently trading for around $60, which paid for my whole day at the tournament. This is a very good card, but I think its price is inflated right now, so once I'm done with my homework today I'm going to the shop to get some good trade value for it while the price is still so inflated.</p>
