Hello all,

I have been a long time member of a public access unix system named sdf.lonestar.org ever since my Berkeley days, I always host my homepage there, and link to this current blog from there, I recently decided that I need to make more use of their systems, and integrate more with my actual homepage, so I exported all the files from this blog and imported them over there. I will no longer update this blog (at least I think so) and please re-fix your bookmarks (and subscriptions) to my new blog site <a href="http://woh3.sdf.org/wordpress/">http://woh3.sdf.org/wordpress/</a>
