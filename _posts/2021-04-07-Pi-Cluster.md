I am putting together my first Raspberry Pi 4 4-node cluster computer. I plan to use it for fractal rendering. I plan to start with this small cluster first until I get my sea-legs and then plan to migrate it to a much larger water cooled cluster. <br clear="all">

This is the case I plan to use and the 4 Pi units arrive Thursday.
