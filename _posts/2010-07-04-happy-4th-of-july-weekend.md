Happy Fourth of July Weekend Everyone! For this first time in 6 weeks I did not have to work the weekend, and am just trying to stay out of the heat, maybe swim, catch up on some reading and coding, currently reading "The Magicians" by Lev Grossman, it's very good, it reminds me a lot of "The Secret History" and to some extent Harry Potter.

I went out to Sushi today with a coworker of mine, and as always, it was delicious, i took a photo, but it came out blurry, so not posting it here.
