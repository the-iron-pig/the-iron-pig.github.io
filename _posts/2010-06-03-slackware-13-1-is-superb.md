<p>I've been using Slackware for years, and never seen a release come out so quickly, perhaps this is a new phase in rspeedy releases for slack. It runs powerfully and smooth, with many features pre-configured, and the flashplayer plugin script in the /extra directory of the DVD actually works, unlike in slack 13.0</p>
