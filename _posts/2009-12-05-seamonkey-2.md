You know, Seamonkey 2, the new version of the web browser that was supplanted by Firefox is out. The main thing that strikes me about this new browser is the DISTINCT ABSENCE of FLASHBLOCK!!!! So unless they give me a plugin to block flash, then it wouldn't matter if their browser made me ten years younger, wealthy or cured my allergy to republicans, IM NOT GOING TO USE IT! The people working on Seamonkey 2 are total boneheads if they don't understand that FLASH is the single most abused technology on the internet, and that FLASHBLOCK is the only way to fly on the internet now.
