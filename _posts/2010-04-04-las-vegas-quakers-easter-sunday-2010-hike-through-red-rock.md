I just got back from our worship groups hike at Red Rock Canyon National Park, we all met at the visitors center, hiked around a bit on the Moenkopi trail, and then went to Calico picnic area to have our potluck, the wind was insane, and several of us had to cut our meeting short due to wind, but it was a lot of fun.<a href="http://woh3blog.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dscn0669.jpg"><img src="http://woh3blog.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dscn0669.jpg?w=300" alt="north view from red rock canyon visitors center" title="DSCN0669" width="300" height="224" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-364" /></a>
