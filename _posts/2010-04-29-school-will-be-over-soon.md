The end is in sight, and I am going crazy, I don't know if its just psychological or what but my brain feels like a fried egg, and I can't bare the thought of looking at another line of computer code for a few weeks, whatever my next self improvement project is going to be, I think I'm going to take a few months of me time before I start it. Maybe I'll take some time to work on body, and give the brain a little rest, perhaps tai-chi or judo.
