I got fired today, and I have an excellent work ethic and the notion of getting fired would normally seem like a blemish on my record, but I am freakin' relieved that I do not have to work with that woman anymore. She has a disorder, maybe a variation of OCD with an overbearing dose of hyper-vigilance disorder, but absolutely no one within her sphere of influence feels safe around her. Please please please seek help, this can't be making you, your family, or those around you happy. These times are hard for all of us, and wigging out about protecting yourself will not help you stay afloat any more than the rest of us. I really hope you get help before you let this get even more out of control.
