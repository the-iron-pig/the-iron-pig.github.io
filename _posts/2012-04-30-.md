<p>My birthday is July 18th, 1971. I was born in Bakersfield, California and traveled around quite a bit, in fact my family and I spent a couple of years living and traveling around in a converted Short School bus very much like this one below...</p><p>after a while I wound up in Vegas, briefly escaped to go 1.5 years at U.C. Berkeley, before my karma sucked me back in. </p><p>Many people are charmed by Vegas, and the notion of living there seems to be a novel one, but let me tell you from experience, when the money is rolling in and the economy is good Vegas is like a Paradise, but when the economy tanks, the jobs dry up and the money isn't rolling in anymore, Vegas is a very dark place where people turn nasty on each other, and try their damnedest to bleed each other dry. </p><p>So it was on my birthday, July 18th, 2011 that my partner (whom I love very much) brought me my 40th birthday cake with candles blazing, and I closed my eyes, and with all my heart wished---in these exact words---"please please please God, let me and Joe get out of Vegas soon and go some place, any place, but...just let it be someplace green!" and I blew out the candles. It only seemed like a few weeks later that a friend started mentioning some possibilities of new work on Facebook, and shortly after that I was interviewing and only a few weeks after that Joe and I had plain tickets to Hawai'i. It seems my wish had been granted! </p><p>I came to Hawai'i to be a lab technician for The Monorail Project, which has recently struck ground, and the very first ever bathes of concrete (hopefully the first of many) were poured, here is historical documentation...photos of the first truck pouring the first load</p><p><a href="http://woh3blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/spaceout.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://woh3blog.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/spaceout.gif?w=-9" alt="Image" /></a></p>
