I have to admit, I thought he was gonna suck, and that the folks at the BBC were going to give <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/doctor-who/index.jsp">Doctor Who</a> a quiet send off with a lame actor, but the new season shows stronger than ever, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor)">Matt Smith </a>is awesome as the new doctor. He is very handsome, and his new companion is smoking hot.
