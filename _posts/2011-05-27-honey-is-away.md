Well, I have been fortunate enough to meet and share my life with a wonderful guy. He had to go back to New Jersey this week for a funeral, and I miss him already. It's strange sleeping alone now, and now having someone to talk to. I've decided to use the time creatively, I am researching, and writing again. Don't want to talk too much about it here right now, but I can tell you it has ghosts and detectives in it. I am still working at the electronics company and some interesting things are happening there. I plan to go to Friday Night Magic this week with my friends Bob and Ian. My tomato plant now has three green tomatoes on it. Joe's cat Mojo is a relentless attention hog which wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't able to cover me in hair without even touching me. I downloaded and installed the new Slackware64 13.37 and have been having a good time playing around with command line and scripting things. I have been on a diet, and it's not going so wonderfully this week so far, but in all I started about a month and a half ago and have lost 21 lbs. I have been reading most of Rudy Rucker's works while I wait for the release of his new book in a couple of months called "Jim and the Flims". I honestly think he probably chose that name to confuse online search engines...google returns "are you sure you didn't mean films?" Who knows. Well, can't waste too much time online otherwise I will never get passed my outline. Will post soon
