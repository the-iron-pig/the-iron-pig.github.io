I just ordered a lovely looking Vegan Ham for Christmas dinner, it looks wonderful. Can't wait to try it. Ordered from <a href="http://www.myrtlegreens.com/">Myrtlegreens</a><br>
2021-01-04 Update: I hate to say it but this thing was AWFUL! Squishy with no real texture and tasteless. I would not recommend this to anyone.
