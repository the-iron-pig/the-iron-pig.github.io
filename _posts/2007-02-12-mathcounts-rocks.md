last weekend I was proctoring and helping out at the Las Vegas Mathcounts tournament, a place where kids who are good at math come to have fun. One of the event managers said "This is the coolest and most important thing going on in American schools right now, and you won't see it on TV, or hear about it on the radio" he was absolutely right.
