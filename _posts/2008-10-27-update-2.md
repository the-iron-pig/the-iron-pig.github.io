Things have been a little disappointing lately, can't lie about that. There is a dinner this Tuesday for the Las Vegas Go Club, not particularly looking forward to it, in fact, kind of dreading it. I have been working pretty solid for the last year and a half on trying to resurrect the Go club here in Vegas, scheduling our meets, booking our rooms, giving demonstration games at local hotels and events, and sometimes sitting in an empty room for hours, and at this coming dinner I have been deemed worthy of the vice-president office. Now I am not one for titles, and I'm not even sure I would want the presidency of the club, but still it somehow feels like being robbed of the fruits of your labor. Well, there's no arguing with the masses, whatever will be will be.
