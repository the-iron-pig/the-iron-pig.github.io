I had to terminate an employee for ths first time today. It was difficult,mainly because I like him and identified
with him. Sadly hejust kept making too many mistakes. I shook his hand, wished him luck and told him to never give up on his quest for self-improvement and education. All in all, he took it pretty well, but it still sucked.
