So when I was 11, I had to run away from home. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make, and probably the most unfair one, as I was forced to make it too early, and it made me feel like the world's worst person as I had to abandon my mother and brothers to the clutches of a devious and brutally violent man-child. In my entire life, I never felt so small or worthless from acting out of self-preservation. I had nightmares for years afterward and was often contradictorily labeled emotionally needy and emotionally distant at the same time in the various group homes and foster homes through the following years. 
Flash-forward 40 years. I graduated from University. I have had a decade of financial and emotional stability that I never had before. I still have depression and PTSD, and my doctor tells me I probably will for life. 
I am about to undergo a medically prescribed and supervised Ketamine treatment. The doctor is on a video conference with me, my husband is next to me to help manage. I take the pills, they are revolting, and I have to take an extra dose of the anti-nausea meds. About a half-hour later I begin to feel something and go to my prepared space, put on the blindfold, and put on the headphones with the relaxing music. My dog seems to sense something is happening with me and takes a defensive position next to me. A few moments later the world begins to spin. After that I realize I may have taken too much, the blindfold no longer matters, the music no longer matters, time no longer matters...and I am in another dimension. Literally.

I find myself on a desert planet in the middle of a sandstorm. I wander and am lost. I spend hours lost in the sandstorm, trapped in the ebb and flow of its breathes, wondering if they have any connection to the breathing of my body back on Earth, lying on the floor being protected by my husband and dog, or if I really am disconnected from all of that and truly lost in some other dimension. I don't know how I know this is another planet but I just do. Then, for a moment, the sandstorm abates, and my mother appears to me. She is smiling, she looks young, and she says to me "Hello darling" in a way that lets me know this is my mother from when her mind and her spirit were still vibrant and alive. I am so happy to see her that way again. Then she is gone like she was never there. I am simultaneously overjoyed and heartbroken from the all too brief experience. 
Off in the distance I see a city, and then suddenly I am there. I realize that this world is the planet Arrakis, from the Sci-Fi novel Dune. Dune was my mother's favorite Sci-Fi novel (her favorite novel of all time was Shogun) ,and due to her influence it was a favorite of mine as well. If this is Arrakis, then, this city must be its Capitol, the city of Arrakeen. i see the smooth sandblasted stone, hundreds of meters deep in some places. Deep under that stone is powerful and vibrant life. Then I come to realize that all of this is metaphor. All just a metaphor for myself and my mind. Life, intelligence, Sensitivity, Power, all within, then a hard protective shell, then storms and outer space without. It was me. 
I began to come to in the real world. My loyal husband and protective dog waiting for me. It took about an hour for me to totally recover. In the post interview the doctor asked me about the experience, and I said that I was "confused." She said that was "okay."
In the months after the experience, I haven't repeated the therapy, even though I have been asked about it. If I ever do, I would probably prefer about 1/8th the dose. I often wondered why I came to the Sci-Fi novel Dune as my cathartic experience and then I realized that there was always the theme in the novel about "the sleeper awakening" as a metaphor for the novel supreme being, but in my own personal catharsis it was plainly metaphor for my self actualization. 
As I approach my 51st birthday, I find myself wondering about how to transform myself from work in progress to masterpeice. Not that I expect perfection, but I need to self direct my life more. I escaped the destiny that was distated for me by the foster homes and my birth and statistics, but I am by no means self actualized yet. My views on God are unconventional but sometimes I picture him as supreme photo editor for National Geographic, looking through his magnifying lense at cover photo submissions, and I wonder what I have to do tomake the cut. 
The sleeper has not yet awakened, in fact, he is only in the process of reaching for his morning coffee. But hey, better late than never.
