The new X-Files movie left me wanting more, and not in a good way, there were no aliens, no ghosts, a dubious moral situation with a pedophile priest seeking redemption and a two headed dog. They chose to spin the movie as a silence of the lambs type of thriller, racing the clock to save the girl but everything, including the tension just fell flat. I am/was a long time fan of the x-files, and i even moderately liked the first movie, but this was little more than a walking party for old characters, without their old flare. If you could get this movie for free on redbox monday, go ahead, other than that, avoid it.
